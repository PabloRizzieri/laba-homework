# Class Hierarchy Homework

This homework assignment involves creating a class hierarchy based on a topic provided by the mentors. The requirements for the hierarchy are as follows:

- Implementation of at least 10 classes
- Inclusion of properties in all classes (minimum of 1)
- Incorporation of at least 5 private properties across the classes
- Provision of getters and setters for all private variables
- Inclusion of at least one custom constructor in each class
- Creation of a separate class with main() for object instantiation

The project aims to demonstrate understanding and proficiency in building complex class hierarchies, encapsulation, and object-oriented programming principles.
